# NOTES for me
I am currently trying to make unique pages that will fetch data from the specific recipe. 


FLOW
In this context:

my searchRecipe.ts in the pages/api/ folder manages the logic for searching recipes based on user queries.
my recipeDetails.ts in the same pages/api/ folder handles retrieving detailed data about a specific recipe using its ID.
And the component pages/recipe/[id].tsx interfaces with the recipeDetails.ts route to display detailed information to the end user.

To move forward, ensure:

my recipeDetails.ts API route is correctly set up
my [id].tsx component correctly interfaces with this API route.
If the above in place and everything is wired up correctly, navigating to a URL like /recipe/{some_recipe_id} in my Next.js app should display the detailed information for the given recipe ID.

Make sure that list/search for recipes (perhaps using the searchRecipe.ts API route), provide links to the detailed view using the format /recipe/{recipe_id} so users can click on them to view detailed information.


## From ChatGPT help
I had trouble getting the right URL and redux states but I got it now heres what it says:

es, based on the structure you've shared, you can extract additional information.

Here's a breakdown of the data you've provided and what you can grab:

URI: This is a unique identifier for the recipe.

How to grab: data['recipe']['uri']
Label: The name of the recipe.

How to grab: data['recipe']['label']
Image: The primary image URL for the recipe.

How to grab: data['recipe']['image']
Thumbnail Image: The thumbnail image URL for the recipe.

How to grab: data['recipe']['images']['THUMBNAIL']['url']
Width: data['recipe']['images']['THUMBNAIL']['width']
Height: data['recipe']['images']['THUMBNAIL']['height']
Small Image: The small image URL for the recipe.

How to grab: data['recipe']['images']['SMALL']['url']
Note: I don't see the width and height for the small image in the truncated JSON you've provided, but I assume they can be accessed in a similar way as the thumbnail if they exist.
If the API provides more data beyond what you've shown in this structure, you'd just need to navigate the JSON in a similar manner to grab what you need.

As always, make sure you're adhering to any terms of service or usage limits of the API, and take care when handling data, especially if displaying it publicly.
