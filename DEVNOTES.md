# NOTES for me
I am currently trying to make unique pages that will fetch data from the specific recipe. 


FLOW
In this context:

my searchRecipe.ts in the pages/api/ folder manages the logic for searching recipes based on user queries.
my recipeDetails.ts in the same pages/api/ folder handles retrieving detailed data about a specific recipe using its ID.
And the component pages/recipe/[id].tsx interfaces with the recipeDetails.ts route to display detailed information to the end user.

To move forward, ensure:

my recipeDetails.ts API route is correctly set up
my [id].tsx component correctly interfaces with this API route.
If the above in place and everything is wired up correctly, navigating to a URL like /recipe/{some_recipe_id} in my Next.js app should display the detailed information for the given recipe ID.

Make sure that list/search for recipes (perhaps using the searchRecipe.ts API route), provide links to the detailed view using the format /recipe/{recipe_id} so users can click on them to view detailed information.
